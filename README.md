## Info

This app is based on the [Rainbowkit](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit/tree/main/examples) examples. It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You will need to configure an `.env` or `.env.local` file from `.env.example` and provide the contract address and the Alchemy API key.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
